          <h2>What I'm Looking For</h2>

          <p>
            I'm looking for more responsibility with my next role. I like to
            take on impactful projects where the difference the code I write can
            be seen on a day to day basis.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'd like to mentor younger developers as well- I didn't have this
            early on in my career, so providing that opportunity for someone
            else would feel great for me!
          </p>

        <div class="content-text story">
          <h2>My Story</h2>

          <p>
            when i was a young boy, my father took me into the city to see a
            marching band.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't come from a conventional coding background. I grew up going
            to music school, and continued on with that through college. After
            leaving college (DNF), I worked as a transaction coordinator in the
            real estate industry for a few years. Real estate wasn't a great fit
            for me, so I was met with the decision to either return to school or
            find another way to get a skill so that I'd be employable (thanks
            capitalism)
          </p>

          <p>
            I took a couple Udemy courses and decided that I was interested
            enough in coding to try and make the career switch. I attended
            DevMountain's web development program, then was able to get a job
            shortly after.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of my work has been focused around consuming/developing APIs
            and bridging the gap between two software companies with
            integrations. I'm always looking to learn more and sharpen my
            skills.
