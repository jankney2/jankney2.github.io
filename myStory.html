          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>
            I grew up in Virginia and moved to Utah to study music at college.
            After school, I worked as a transaction coordinator for a local
            Keller Williams real estate team for a few years. I learned a lot,
            and eventually decided to pursue a career in software development.
          </p>

          <p>
            I took a couple Udemy coding courses and decided that I was ready to
            try and make the career switch. I attended DevMountain's web
            development program, and was able to get a job shortly thereafter.
          </p>

          <p>
            I worked for a large pest control company (Greenix) and developed a
            node.js application for them that determined how much monthly bonus
            each of their employees should get, then displayed that info in a
            dashboard for each employee. After several months of aggregating
            data for the app, I started using that data to create reports and
            lists for the company that helped identify which employees were
            potentially gaming the system. Additionally, I was able to provide
            reports to the scheduling team that helped make the company's truck
            routes more efficient, which resulted in significant savings for the
            company.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Greenix, I moved to a real estate software company called
            Sisu. I was brought on as a member of their new strategic
            integrations team. Sisu sells software to real estate agents and
            brokerages, and most of their customers utilize some type of
            customer relationship management software (or CRM). During my time
            at Sisu I've developed and maintained integrations for four major
            CRMs that realtors use- Follow Up Boss, Sierra, Boomtown, and
            BoldTrail. Being able to sync data between a CRM and Sisu is a key
            component for Sisu's customers to hold their employee's accountable,
            and each integration that I've completed has allowed Sisu to target
            new customers that use that specific CRM, which grows our client
            base.
